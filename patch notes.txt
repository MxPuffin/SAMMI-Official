Hotfix:
- Fixed a bug where "Latest Version" isn't selected by default. [Roadie]

Important Security Patch:
- Disabled file saving/modification/deletion from folders outside of your main LB directory.
  - The LB Dev team discovered that previous versions of LioranBoard 2 allowed any files on your computer
to be modified, even if they were outside of the main LB directory. This meant that previously, anyone
could delete/modify your decks, or any important files on your PC, with a single command.
