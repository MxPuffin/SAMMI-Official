New Features:

  - This helps us add even more features later on
  - DLLExtension.dll can be safely removed from SAMMI folder (SAMMI Updater should automatically delete the file)
- New SAMMI Panel to replace SAMMI Deck, web and app version both available (currently in beta) [Roadie]

  - For advanced usage and better control over your versions, you can launch SAMMI Updater separately, which allows you to update, download, or downgrade individual components.
